	<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. </p>

	<p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a <del>crappy</del> <ins>bad</ins> spray <del>gun</del> <ins>weapon</ins> from South Miami. This <del>gun</del> <ins>weapon</ins> is advertised as the most popular <del>gun</del> <ins>weapon</ins> in American crime. Do you believe that <del>shit?</del> <ins>thing</ins> It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular <del>gun</del> <ins>weapon</ins> in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that <del>shit</del> <ins>thing</ins>.  </p>

But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much <del>shit</del> <ins>bad things</ins> this morning over this case to hand it over to your <del>dumb ass</del> <ins>beautifull being</ins>. </p>
